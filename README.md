# DroneDeliveryCode
The project is a model of a small autonomous drone delivery system

Material list:
  - DJI Tello drone
  - Two $2 Canadian coins and two $1 Canadian coins

The project implement the Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between way points selected by the user

The project is fully scalable

# This branch is used for testing the Dijkstra's algorithm. Please go to _master_ branch to see the complete code
